    r"""The stat types you want this endpoint to return information on. See also the <a href=\"/docs/telematics#query-parameters\" target=\"_blank\">Telematics</a> guide for more details.

    You may list ***up to 3*** types using comma-separated format. For example: `types=gps,engineStates,obdOdometerMeters`.

    *Note:* `auxInput3`-`auxInput10` count as a single type against the limit of 3. For example, you could list `types=engineStates,obdOdometerMeters,auxInput3,auxInput4` because `auxInput3` and `auxInput4` count as a single stat type. `auxInput1` and `auxInput2` still count as their own individual types.

    - `ambientAirTemperatureMilliC`: The ambient air temperature reading in millidegree Celsius.
    - `auxInput1`-`auxInput13`: Stat events from the <a href=\"https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043040512-Auxiliary-Inputs\" target=\"_blank\">auxiliary inputs</a> for the vehicle.
    - `barometricPressurePa`: The barometric pressure reading in pascals.
    - `batteryMilliVolts`: The vehicle battery voltage reading.

    - `engineCoolantTemperatureMilliC`: The engine coolant temperature reading in millidegree Celsius.
    - `engineImmobilizer`: The state of the engine immobilizer - Valid values: `ignition_disabled`, `ignition_enabled`. This stat type will only return states of our first Engine Immobilizer Hardware (ACC-EI). Please use <a href=\"https://developers.samsara.com/reference/getengineimmobilizerstates\" target=\"_blank\">Get engine immobilizer states</a> to get states for both Engine Immobilizer Hardware versions (incl. HW-EI21).
    - `engineLoadPercent`: The engine load in percentage points (e.g. `99`, `50`, etc).
    - `engineOilPressureKPa`: The engine oil pressure reading in kilopascals.

Manual odometer readings can be provided via the [PATCH /fleet/vehicles/{id}](ref:updatevehicle) endpoint or through the <a href=\"https://kb.samsara.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005273667-Editing-Odometer-Reading\" target=\"_blank\">cloud dasbhoard</a>. Odometer readings that are manually set will update as GPS trip data is gathered. Try combining with `obdOdometerMeters`.

    - `nfcCardScans`: ID card scans.
    - `obdEngineSeconds`: The cumulative number of seconds the engine has run according to onboard diagnostics.
